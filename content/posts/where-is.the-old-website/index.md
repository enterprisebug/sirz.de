Sometimes you just need to try something new! In this case i built the website with Hugo

<!--more-->

## Why Hugo?

I did not like the fact to have a requirement to PHP.

I like the idea of a framework that generates static files.

I stumpled upon a twitter post from Thorsten Hans:
{{< tweet user="ThorstenHans" id="1686279472180269056" >}}

I did not hear anything about Hugo, but i know Thorsten is a absolute tech geek. So i gave Hugo a try and really liked it.
